Traffic Sign Recognition: Enhancing Road Safety through Computer Vision
# The main objective of the Traffic Sign Recognition project is to develop a computer vision system that can accurately detect and classify traffic signs from images or video frames. The goal is to improve road safety by enabling automated recognition of traffic signs, which can assist drivers, autonomous vehicles, and traffic management systems in real-time decision-making.
